# Code of Conduct & Written Agreement - Team 9

All Team members should:
- Treat each other’s contributions / critique and comments with respect.
- Be open to questions and help within reason. Something that could be googled
maybe not, however if still unsure ask. If you don’t ask, you’ll be missing a trick.
- Be open to everyone's different levels of understanding, as a team our basic level
of understanding would be that of the content taught up until this point.
- Act professionally towards each other. We are all adults. Help out if
needed in an acceptable time period. 1 working day wait time for a response.
- Be truthful in contributions and progress with the team. Don’t lie about your
progress or over extend yourself to the point you feel the work set out is too
ambitious for the current sprint.
- Make sure there is a point of contact established for when we aren't meeting in
person. EG: Discord / Teams.
- Credit work done by each member of the team accordingly.
- Respect team members' commitments, and respect the fact that they may not be
able to attend for some reason. Clearly if they do it too often for an invalid reason
then make lecturers aware. It is a team project after all, all members contribute to
the best of their abilities and equally share the task for the current sprint at the
time.

If these are not met and the reason / circumstances are not valid:
- A lecturer will be informed
- Let’s not get to this point 🙂

However, if these are not met with a valid reason / circumstance:
- We will take it into consideration and maybe share your task between the others
in the group. Or someone who has finished early may be happy to take up the
task.

If a team member fails to deliver what they had promised then we would make sure they
had asked for relevant help prior, then discuss our next options. Maybe we will have to
pick up / or drop for the next iteration.

Team decisions will be made as a group - discussed preferably on the days we are
expected to be in, in person (Tuesday, Friday).

If a dispute cannot be resolved within the team - inform a lecturer and see what they
suggest.

Roles - will take on all roles throughout the course of the project phase to gain
experience. Will be allocated accordingly at the time.
Overall, be open to each other, help if and when needed. If you feel like you are being
left behind just speak up. We can’t tell if anything is going wrong with development if you don’t speak up. In short, just communicate
:).
